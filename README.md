The web application is built using flask and pymongo.
It allows you to perform CRUD operations for users, creatives, briefs and skills.
It has a form for logging in user and a form for contacting the creative/employer.
The application provides contact information and a link to Megapixels marketing services.
You can find the application [here](https://creative-hub.herokuapp.com/).

## UX

The application is designed using the [materialize](https://materializecss.com/) framework.
It is designed to be user friendly, simple and clean with the purpose to present all information in a visually appealing manner on all devices.
It is made for creatives/employers who wants to connect with one another.
They want to be able to create a user, creative ads and briefs.

![alt text](static/images/contact-information.jpg "Contact Information")

### Strategy

The goal with the application is to provide employers and creative a way to connect.
The design should fit the purpose and coming from the [materialize](https://materializecss.com/) framework.
The foundation of the application should be solid with room for improvement for future updates/releases.

### Scope

The users should be able to use a fully functioning application for performing CRUD operations and sending an e-mail form.
At this stage the user will experience a running application with the possibility to perform CRUD operations
and let others know you are interested in connecting.

Future releases may introduce:
A wider range of functionalities and ways to interact
The possibility to rate users
Provide more valuable information and resources

### Structure

The application has a natural structure with the "home-section" giving a message, in this case welcoming the user to the application and describes how to use it.
It's easy to navigate to the different sections of the page and perform desired CRUD operations.

### Skeleton

In this [link](https://github.com/robinwesterback/creative-hub/tree/master/wireframes) you can find the wireframes for each section that serves as the skeleton for the project.

### Surface

In this [link](https://materializecss.com/) you can find Materialize.
This application is built using materialize css, components and js.

## Features

The application contains several features with a few left to be implemented.

### Existing Features

#### Navbar

A materialize [component](https://materializecss.com/navbar.html "Materialize Navbar") with a hamburger menu for mobile.

#### Footer

A materialize [component](https://materializecss.com/footer.html "Materialize Footer").

#### Icons

A materialize [component](https://materializecss.com/icons.html "Materialize Icons").

#### Forms

##### Text Inputs

##### Select

Materialize [form select](https://materializecss.com/select.html "Materialize Select").

##### Date picker

Materialize [form date picker](https://materializecss.com/pickers.html "Materialize Pickers").

#### User login

The application allows the user to log in and out of a session.

#### CRUD Operations

The application operates to a MongoDB with 4 collections - users, briefs, creatives and skills.

##### Create document

The application allows the user to create a document in the MongoDB.

##### Read document

The application allows the user to read a document in the MongoDB.

##### Update document

The application allows the user to update a document in the MongoDB.

##### Delete document

The application allows the user to delete a document in the MongoDB.

#### Send email

I use [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/ "EmailJS") to let the user send emails to the site owner.
The user gets notified wether it is a success or of it fails.

### Features Left to Implement

#### Smarter interactivity for users

Make functions, collections and the exchange of information between users better.
E.g. pagination, search functions for retrieving data from the backend, categorized in a more user friendly way as the application grows larger.

#### Recourses, functions and content

Provide more information, resources and possibilities to create better ads to improve success rate for user interaction.

#### Add images, links etc.

Give users the ability to add images, documents, links etc.

#### Defensive design

Make the application more compatible with browsers other than Chrome. Customize the 404 error webpage.
More secure way to log in.

#### Livechat and chat function

I might add a livechat for contacting the site owner and a chat function for communication between users.

#### Your thoughts

Are there any features that you would like me to implement to improve the application? Please get in touch and share your thoughts.

## Technologies Used

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Flask and MongoDB to build this project.

### HTML

This project uses semantic [HTML](https://html.com/ "HTML") to improve SEO and user friendliness.
The HTML is rendered from the templates directory.

### CSS

The project uses responsive design to improve the user experience and availability on all devices.
The [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html "CSS") is separated using comments.
It is rendered from the static directory.

### JS

I used [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/ "JavaScript") for some of the functions and interactivity on the application.
Comments are provided to give an explanation of the functions.
It is rendered from the static directory.

### Python

I used [Python](https://www.python.org/ "Python") for some of the functions and interactivity on the application.
Comments are provided to give an explanation of the functions.

### Flask

I used [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/ "Flask") to create the web application.
Here is a [cheatsheet](https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/prettyprinted/flask_cheatsheet.pdf/ "Flask Cheatcheet").

### MongoDB

I used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/ "MongoDB") for the database and [PyMongo](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/ "PyMongo") to interact with it.

## Testing

I have tested the application and looked for flaws in the design and errors in the functionality on several browsers on desktop, laptop and iPhone 7.
I have also tested the user stories to see if the application fills its purpose towards the user.
The expected outcome is that the application is responsive and functional on all browsers/devices.
Functions like links, CRUD operations and contact forms should work properly e.g "target=”\_blank"" where appropriate. Below are my findings and comments.

### Functionality

| Description                                    |                   Expected outcome                   | Pass | Comments |

### Different Browsers and devices

#### Desktop

| Description     |          Expected outcome           | Pass | Comments |
| --------------- | :---------------------------------: | ---: | -------: |
| Microsoft Edge  | The application works appropriately |  Yes |        - |
| Google Chrome   | The application works appropriately |  Yes |        - |

### Responsiveness

I have tested the responsiveness of the application [here](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/# "Am I Responsive?") and it is responsive.

![alt text](src/assets/images/responsive-app.jpg "I am responsive!")

### Code validation

#### CSS

I validated my CSS with the [Jigsaw W3C Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ "CSS Validation").
1 error was located related to materialize. As the application works as intended it's nothing to be concerned about.
Therefore I choose to leave it for now even though jigsaw regards the CSS as an error.

#### HTML

I validated my HTML with the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/ "HTML Validator") with no errors to show.

### Defensive design

I've implemented defensive designs throughout the application. Fields are required before submitting.
`maxLength` is applied to `input` fields. Error messages pops up where appropriate.
Email confirmation message pops up after successfully sent email.
There are more defensive design you can add to improve the user experience,
such as confirmation before deleting a creative ad/brief or adding interactive questionmarks that provide relevant information.

### Conclusion

After testing the deployed application my overall conclusion is that the application is working as intended.
It has a lot of potential to provide even more value for the user with future installations of the application.
The javascript and python works as intended.
The minor flaws that exist don’t ruin the user experience but should be corrected in the future.
